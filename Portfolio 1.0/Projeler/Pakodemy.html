            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>Pakodemy is a online platform that provides online tests, online trial, question solution videos, lecture
                videos, etc. to students preparing for LGS and YKS exams in our country. We are planning to develop this
                platform in partnership with its founder, in a way that students can access more questions for a monthly
                subscription fee, and by adding many different features that will contribute positively to their course
                work. By taking note of the features that can be added to the work and demo We started by developing an
                interface. The application interface you see here belongs to this demo.</p>
            <h2>Lectures</h2>
            <p>As seen in the video, there are many different course options on the Courses page. Students will be able
                to choose the course they want from the course options on this page and solve the questions of this
                course from the publishing house they want. Although a certain subscription fee will have to be paid to
                use this feature, there are many problems rather than paying 100 lira for a test book. It will be more
                economical for all students to pay less for a platform. At the same time, students will be able to
                reinforce the topics by watching lecture videos on the courses page, and if they wish, they will be able
                to participate in online trials and see their rankings.</p>
            <h2>Stats</h2>
            <p>Statistics page is a page where many important data that enables students to follow their status are
                displayed in graphs. On this page, students will be able to see many important data such as the number
                of questions they have solved daily, weekly, test nets, test sequences, question solution times. It will
                be much easier for them to follow.</p>
            <h2>Forum</h2>
            <p>The forum page will be a place where students can consult each other on subjects such as study
                discipline, exam psychology, choosing a department, and at the same time throw questions that they
                cannot solve or cannot understand. In this way, it will be much easier for students to take their
                decisions and understand the questions they cannot solve.</p>
            <h2>Friends</h2>
            <p>It can be very useful for students to go along with their friends during the study process by seeing
                their status. On the friends page of the application, you will be able to see how many questions your
                friends in your friend list have solved compared to yourself. At the same time, you will be able to add
                your friends to the groups you have established and compete with them by solving questions in real time.
            </p>
            <h2>Groups</h2>
            <p>Thanks to the groups, you will be able to form groups with your own friends and see each other's test
                order on this group, the questions you have solved, and you will be able to help each other by throwing
                the questions that you could not solve in the group.</p>
            <h2>My Profile</h2>
            <p>From the My Profile section, just like in many other applications, your profile photo, username, etc.
                You will be able to edit information, adjust application settings and see values such as your score. In
                addition, schools and teachers will be able to follow the status of their students much more closely by
                establishing groups.
