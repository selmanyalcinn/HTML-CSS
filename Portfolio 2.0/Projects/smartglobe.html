            <div style="margin-top: 20px;width: 70%;"><h3><p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">In this project, our goal was to develop an educational tool to simplify geography lessons. I developed the website, while my teammate M. Kemal designed the globe's circuits and programmed the Arduino. We connected the website and globe using Arduino keyboard libraries, with the Arduino simulating keyboard hex-codes via a USB cable connected to my PC, which we then read on the website.</p></h3>

                <h3><p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">We used capacitive touch sensors on the globe's surface to detect when a user touched a selected country. Upon touch, the Arduino sent the corresponding keyboard hex-code for that country. This allowed me to identify which country the user touched, enabling the creation of interactive culture, flag, and map games, as well as an explore mode.</p></h3>
                
                <h3><p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">In the games, users were tasked with finding and selecting the correct country on the globe within 25 seconds, based on information such as flags, cultural objects, or maps. In explore mode, I displayed detailed information, including the country's capital, currency, flag, languages, and more.</p></h3>
                
                <h3><p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">As a result of this project, we earned a high ranking in a prestigious national competition and significantly improved our teamwork skills.</p></h3>
